  A class mod for Badlur's Gate 3
  <br>
</h1>

### Introduction
This mod adds a new class named "Mutant" to the [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/). The class is based on Marvel's X-Men comics and heavily borrows skills and abilities from the characters. It is intended for people who want to replay the game with a choose-what-you-can-do class.

### What is this class about?
Your body is being genetically modified by what has been named **X-Gene**. As you level up, you decide your capabilities by choosing "Mutations" that fit your needs. The mutations go from making "TalkToAnimals" and "DetectThoughts" statuses permanent (Charles Xavier) to being able to teleport as bonus action (Nightcrawler). The cantrips and spells you are able to accquire as a **Mutant** are limited to what could be "Superpowers". You will not be casting spells where you pray to the gods to heal your allies, infuse a weapon with magic or conjure an elemental being.

While the Mutations are sure to give you an edge, at Level 12 your body becomes the host of a powerful parasitical cosmic entity called The Phoenix Force. It lends you a very significant passive of your choice which may change the way you approach combat if used creatively.

Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't let you level up a class beyond Level 12 but if you choose to do so using a mod, The Phoenix takes it as an act of defiance and gets pissed. For every level you go beyond 12, it will reduce your max HP by 7%. At Level 19, the Phoenix will disable all your Mutations as one last ditch effort to break you. It should be noticed that the -7% HP nerf adding up to this point makes your HP effectively half by you reaching Level 19. However, if you refuse to accept defeat and reach Level 20,  you gain control of the Phoenix Force. Jean Grey too did so in the comics and became omnipotent and omnipresent. As for you, all your ability stats will be increased to 20  and you will regain your HP and Mutations.
