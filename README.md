  A class mod for Badlur's Gate 3
  <br>
</h1>

### Introduction
This mod adds a new class named "Mutant" to the [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/). It is is based on Marvel's X-Men comics and heavily borrows skills and abilities from the characters. It is intended for people who want to replay the game without being stuck with a "role" in the team, a Mutant can be built in many ways.

### What is this class about?
You are a Mutant. Your body is being genetically modified by what has been named **X-Gene**. As you level up, you choose several "Mutations" that fit your vision for your character. There are currently 15 mutationsnd they go from reading minds without using a spell to being able to teleport as a bonus action. You can see the list of unlockable passives [here](Passives.md).

The cantrips and spells that are available to a **Mutant** are the ones that could be plausibe "Superpowers". You will not be casting spells where you pray to the gods to heal your allies, infuse a weapon with magic or summon demons. Spellcasting works as usual and a list of spells you can learn is [here](Spells.md).

While the Mutations are sure to give you an edge, at Level 12 your body becomes the host of a powerful malevolent cosmic entity called The Phoenix Force. It lends you a very significant passive of your choice which may change the way you approach combat if used creatively.

Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't let you level up a class beyond Level 12 but if you choose to do so using a mod, The Phoenix takes it as an act of defiance and gets pissed. I will not spoil what happens after but what I can tell you is that you will be choosing a subclass at Level 20.
