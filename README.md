</h1>

This mod adds a new class named "Mutant" to the [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/). It is is based on Marvel's X-Men comics and heavily borrows skills and abilities from the characters. It is intended for people who want to replay the game without being stuck with a "role" in the team, a Mutant can be built in many ways.
